# shell_config

This repository is meant to hold my personal configuration of fish shell, Neovim and Oh-My-Fish applications as a backup. With recent use of various 'IDE's in comination with VMs, I've been plagued with High resource usage killing my machine. I've opted to search for alternative solutions for my development setup and as such I can accross NeoVim + Tmux as a replacement for an 'IDE'. Please note that this is my preference for my terminal and editor application.

# Fish

Fish shell with 'Solarized Dark' theme. 

# NeoVim

NeoVim with additional configuration for mapping keys for window splitting and movement operations.

# Oh-My-Fish

Omf with 'BobTheFish' theme and Nerd-fonts enabled.
