# shell_config

This repository is meant to hold my personal configuration of shell, editor and command line applications as backup. With recent use of various 'IDE's in combination with VMs, I've been plagued with High resource usage killing my machine. I've opted to search for alternative solutions for my development setup and as such I can accross NeoVim + Tmux as a replacement for an 'IDE'. Please note that this is my preference for my terminal and editor application.

# NeoVim

NeoVim with additional configuration for mapping keys for window splitting, file navigation, rich plugin environment and Lua support.
